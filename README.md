In January 2017 we [reported on the areas of England worst hit by season ticket rises](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-38497987). The figures were based on a Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) list of the most commonly used commuter services in six major cities. Our analysis of the figures was based on full-time workers using an annual season ticket five days a week, except on bank holidays or on 25 days of annual leave.

This was the unit's second story on fare rises following [our previous story on the announcement of season ticket rises in September](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/rail-season-tickets).
